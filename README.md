# pybora
Repository containing the Python wrapper of the Bora.jl emulator

## Installation procedure

Download the folder and run the following command

```
pip install .
```

If everything worked fine, now you can import `pybora` with

```
import pybora.pybora as pb
```

We plan to register `pybora` on `PyPi` registry after releasing the paper in this project.

In the `notebook` folder there is an example showing how to use trained emulators.
